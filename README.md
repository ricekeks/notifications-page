## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Known issues
For some reason I can not get behind at the moment the "Mark all as read" only turns off a few elements. To turn off all elements a total amount of 3 clicks have to be made. Any help or explanation for that behaviour is greatly appreciated.
